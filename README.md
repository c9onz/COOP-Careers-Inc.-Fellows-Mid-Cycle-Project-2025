A repository detailing fellows' 2025 mid-cycle project on healthcare provider shortages and provider need by New York area.

[HRSA Healthcare WorkForce Shortage Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a-5u7Y-1SIZyJmbF69OxKo7tv2l94FygjMKmp024gaA/edit?slide=id.g3890ff4ad4c_0_477#slide=id.g3890ff4ad4c_0_477)<br><br>
This deck was developed by one of the team’s I supervised for COOP Career’s Data Analytics Fellowship & Mid-Cycle project. The team consisted of four individuals with backgrounds in finance, healthcare, economics, and healthcare informatics. 

PROJECT DETAILS: 

**Organization**: Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)<br><br>
**Dataset Used**: HPSA Scores & FTE Shortage Scores
* Represents the number of full-time healthcare provider shortages and providers needed by New York area.
* These scores were further segmented by specialization, such as mental health, dental health, and primary care. 

**Tools Used**: Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau
* Heatmapping and bar charts were used to visualize these shortages and needs in healthcare, however, the concentration of their analysis was on mental health.

**Important Considerations**: 
* Most fellows in the cohort had no prior experience with data analytics, nor extensive experience with the tools we were using. While the deck could have gone further (which I clarified in my critique), there were some interesting things mentioned. Their targets were also accurate.
* Most other cohorts in the program do not use Tableau for the mid-cycle project, simply because the initial demos occur around the same time and teams usually feel less confident about utilizing it effectively. I usually make it a requirement so they have more experience by the time the client capstone is administered. The differences between visualizations created for the mid-cycle project and the client capstone can be found here: [StratusLink Telecommunications Capstone Project](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG10ej2hkY/ssgmudSY5RTXBOfH0KL4Tg/edit)<br>
